- **API Requests**: Unlimited on free tier

**Upgrade when:**

- Storage size exceeds 800 MB
- Need more than 2 concurrent connections

#### Vercel Free Tier Limits:
- **Bandwidth**: 100 GB/month
- **Build Minutes**: 6,000 minutes/month
- **Serverless Function Execution**: 100 GB-hours

**Upgrade when:**
- Traffic exceeds 50,000 visitors/month
- Need team collaboration features

### Phase 2 Features

When ready to add:
1. **Push Notifications**: Use Web Push API + Supabase Realtime
2. **Appointments**: Already have database schema, create UI
3. **Payments**: Integrate Stripe or Senangpay
4. **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics or Mixpanel
5. **Reviews**: Add rating system to completed orders

## Emergency Rollback Procedure

If deployment has critical issues:

1. **Revert in Vercel:**
   - Go to project Deployments
   - Click on previous working deployment
   - Click **Promote to Production**

2. **Revert Database Schema:**
   - Have backup of schema ready
   - Run rollback SQL if needed
   - Supabase provides point-in-time recovery (paid plans)

3. **Communication:**
   - Update customers via WhatsApp/social media
   - Put maintenance notice on website
   - Fix issue in development before redeploying

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs after launch:

- **Order Conversion**: % of visitors who place orders
- **PWA Install Rate**: % of visitors who install PWA
- **Admin Response Time**: Time to respond to orders
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Track via reviews/feedback
- **System Uptime**: Should be > 99.9% (Vercel + Supabase)

## Conclusion

2. Share the URL with a small group of beta users
3. Gather feedback and iterate
4. Officially launch on social media
