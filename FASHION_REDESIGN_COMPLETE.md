## 📐 **Layout Patterns Used**

### 1. **Full-Viewport Hero** (100vh)
```css
h-screen min-h-[600px] max-h-[900px]
```
- Ensures hero is immersive but not too tall
- Maintains mobile usability

### 2. **Asymmetric Service Grid**
```css
lg:row-span-2 /* Featured card spans 2 rows */
```
- Creates visual interest
- Guides eye to signature service

### 3. **Fixed Navigation**
```css
fixed top-0 transition-all duration-500
bg-transparent → bg-neutral-0/95
```
- Always accessible
- Minimal visual weight when transparent

### 4. **Instagram Gallery Pattern**
```css
aspect-square
grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4
```
- Familiar, modern layout
- Perfect for before/after showcases
