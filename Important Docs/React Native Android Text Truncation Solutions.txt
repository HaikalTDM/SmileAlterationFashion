Mastering Text Rendering in React Native: A Definitive Guide to Resolving Truncation on Android




Introduction




Preamble: The Ubiquity of Text Truncation in Cross-Platform Development


Text truncation and clipping are not merely incidental bugs in React Native development; they represent a systemic and recurring challenge inherent to the architecture of cross-platform frameworks. These visual artifacts—ranging from subtly clipped character descenders to entire lines of missing text—are symptoms of the complex abstraction layer that separates a developer's declarative JavaScript code from the highly fragmented and diverse landscape of native Android User Interface (UI) rendering engines.1 The core of the problem lies in the translation of a single, unified set of styling rules into the varied dialects of native text layout and font rendering systems implemented by different device manufacturers and Android versions.
This report provides a definitive technical analysis of text truncation issues on the Android platform within the React Native ecosystem. It moves beyond simple workarounds to offer a deep, systemic understanding of the underlying mechanics. The investigation covers the full spectrum of causes, from nuanced font rendering anomalies and layout paradoxes to version-specific framework regressions. The primary objective is to equip the developer with a comprehensive diagnostic framework and a robust toolkit for both the immediate remediation of existing issues and the architectural prevention of future occurrences. By understanding the fundamental principles of text layout, the specific failure modes on Android, and the advanced strategies for managing typography, developers can build applications that are not only visually correct but also resilient to the inherent variability of the Android ecosystem.
The persistence of these issues across multiple versions of React Native and Android OS underscores a critical reality: text truncation is an "ecosystem problem." It is a manifestation of the friction between a singular cross-platform codebase and the heterogeneous reality of Android OS customizations, proprietary system fonts, and divergent native component implementations across manufacturers. The solutions often involve defensive coding practices that anticipate and mitigate these external variables rather than fixing a singular bug within React Native's core. This reframes the developer's task from simple bug-fixing to a more sophisticated practice of engineering for resilience within a fragmented and constantly evolving mobile environment.


The Expo Go Environment: A Note on Development vs. Production


The user's specified development environment, Expo Go, is an instrumental tool for rapid prototyping and iteration. It allows developers to run React Native projects on a physical device without the need to compile native code, significantly accelerating the development cycle. However, it is imperative to understand the distinction between the Expo Go client's rendering environment and that of a standalone production build or even a development build. Expo Go provides a pre-compiled binary that contains a specific version of the React Native SDK and a suite of common native modules.
This sandboxed nature means that the rendering behavior observed within Expo Go may not perfectly replicate the conditions on all target devices or in a final, compiled application. There are documented cases where layout issues, including text truncation, fail to reproduce in sandboxed environments like Expo Snack (which operates on similar principles to Expo Go) but manifest clearly on emulators and physical hardware running a standalone build.2 This discrepancy arises because a standalone build is compiled directly against the device's specific native libraries and APIs, exposing it to the full range of manufacturer-specific customizations and OS-level quirks that Expo Go's standardized environment might mask.
Furthermore, compatibility between the project's SDK version and the version supported by the installed Expo Go client is critical. Running a project with an unsupported SDK version can lead to a range of unpredictable behaviors or outright failure to load.3 Therefore, while Expo Go is an excellent starting point, a comprehensive testing strategy must include deploying and verifying the application as a standalone development build (npx expo run:android) and, ultimately, as a release build on a diverse portfolio of physical Android devices. Relying solely on Expo Go for UI validation can lead to undiscovered rendering bugs that impact end-users.


The Mechanics of Text Layout in React Native




The Foundational Dichotomy: Flexbox vs. Text Layout


A fundamental concept that must be mastered to understand text rendering in React Native is the existence of two distinct and separate layout systems. The primary layout engine for structuring UI in React Native is an implementation of the CSS Flexbox standard. Components like <View> and other containers use Flexbox to arrange their children, calculate dimensions, and manage alignment along a primary and cross axis.4 This system provides a powerful and consistent model for building responsive UIs.
However, the <Text> component is a unique primitive that operates under a different set of rules. When the layout engine encounters a <Text> element, it delegates the responsibility for arranging its content to the platform's native text rendering engine. Everything inside a <Text> component is no longer governed by Flexbox; it is subject to a specialized text layout system that handles line breaking, font metrics, and inline element arrangement.6 This means that elements nested inside a <Text> component, such as other <Text> nodes, do not behave as rectangular Flexbox items but rather as inline text that wraps at the end of a line.
This dichotomy necessitates a strict structural rule enforced by React Native: all text nodes must be wrapped within a <Text> component. Unlike in web development, where text can be a direct child of a <div>, placing a raw text node as a child of a <View> will raise an exception.6 This strictness is a direct consequence of the two-system architecture, ensuring that the framework can correctly delegate rendering to the appropriate native engine. Understanding this separation is the first step toward diagnosing why text behaves differently from other UI elements.


Parent-Driven vs. Content-Driven Sizing: A Conceptual Model


To build predictable layouts, it is useful to adopt a conceptual model that categorizes component sizing into two modes: "parent-driven" and "content-driven."
* Parent-Driven Sizing: In this mode, a component's dimensions are dictated by its container. A common example is the default behavior of alignItems: 'stretch' in a Flexbox container, which forces child components to expand to fill the available space along the cross axis.7 The parent's properties determine the child's size.
* Content-Driven Sizing: In this mode, a component's dimensions are determined by its own intrinsic content. For example, an <Image> component without explicit width and height props will be sized based on the dimensions of the image file. A <View> with alignSelf: 'flex-start' will shrink to wrap its children. The component's own content dictates its size.
The <Text> component exhibits a unique dual behavior that is a frequent source of layout confusion. By default, a <Text> component's width is parent-driven. It will attempt to expand horizontally to fill the full width of its parent container. Conversely, its height is content-driven. It grows vertically only as much as is necessary to accommodate the lines of text it contains.8 This hybrid sizing model is logical for displaying paragraphs of text, but it becomes a source of conflict when <Text> is used as a peer to other components in a complex layout, leading to the paradox described next.


The Text-in-a-Row Paradox: Deconstructing a Common Failure Case


The most common and illustrative failure case for text truncation arises from what can be termed the "Text-in-a-Row Paradox." This occurs when a <Text> component is placed as a sibling to another element (such as an <Image> icon) inside a container styled with flexDirection: 'row'.7
Consider the following layout:


JavaScript




<View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', width: 300 }}>
 <Image source={require('./icon.png')} style={{ width: 24, height: 24, marginRight: 8 }} />
 <Text>
   This is a very long line of text that is likely to wrap and cause issues.
 </Text>
</View>

In this scenario, two conflicting layout rules come into play:
1. The Text Component Rule: As established, the <Text> component's width is parent-driven. It attempts to occupy the full width of its parent <View> (300 units in this case).
2. The Flexbox Row Item Rule: As an item in a row, the <Text> component's width should be content-driven, allowing it to share horizontal space with its sibling, the <Image>.
React Native resolves this conflict by prioritizing the text component's rule. The <Text> component calculates its required width as if it were the only child in the container, effectively claiming the full 300 units of parent width. It completely ignores the space occupied by its sibling icon.8 The layout engine then places the 24-unit icon and the 300-unit text block into the 300-unit container. The combined width (324 units + margin) exceeds the available space, and because the default for Flexbox items is not to shrink, the <Text> component is pushed partially outside the bounds of its container, resulting in overflow and truncation.8
The solution to this paradox is not a workaround but a correct and necessary application of the Flexbox model. The default behavior for a flex item is flexShrink: 0, meaning it will not shrink below its initial calculated size. To resolve the overflow, the developer must explicitly permit the <Text> component to shrink by setting flexShrink: 1. The common shorthand flex: 1 also achieves this, as it sets flexGrow: 1, flexShrink: 1, and flexBasis: 'auto'.8 Applying flexShrink: 1 to the <Text> style is an instruction to the layout engine: "After calculating the initial (oversized) width for this text, allow it to shrink as needed to fit within the container alongside its siblings." This resolves the paradox by opting the text element into flexible behavior, allowing it to occupy only the remaining space after the icon has been laid out. This understanding elevates the flex: 1 "fix" from a piece of magic to a logical and intentional implementation detail.


A Diagnostic Analysis of Truncation Root Causes


The root causes of text truncation on Android are multifaceted and can be categorized into two primary groups: Static Configuration Errors, which are developer-defined conflicts in layout and styling, and Dynamic Environment Conflicts, which arise from unpredictable runtime conditions imposed by the operating system, device hardware, and user settings. A successful diagnostic process involves first identifying which of these categories the issue falls into. Static issues are typically reproducible across all devices and emulators, whereas dynamic issues are often specific to a particular environment.


Font Rendering and Styling Conflicts




3.1.1. fontWeight and System Font Conflicts on OEM Devices


One of the most widely reported and device-specific causes of text truncation is the use of the fontWeight: 'bold' style property. On Android devices from certain Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)—most notably OnePlus, Oppo, Samsung, and Xiaomi—applying this style can cause the last few characters or words of a text string to be clipped.9
This issue does not appear to be a bug in React Native itself but rather a conflict between the framework's font rendering instruction and the customized system fonts and text rendering libraries used by these manufacturers. When React Native requests a "bold" variant of the default system font, the font metrics (the data describing the size and spacing of each character) returned by the OS may be inaccurate. The layout engine calculates the space needed based on this faulty information, allocating insufficient width for the text, which leads to truncation.10 This is a classic example of a dynamic environment conflict, where code that is perfectly valid fails due to the specifics of the runtime environment.


3.1.2. Custom Font Implementation Pitfalls


When using custom fonts to create a consistent brand identity and avoid system font issues, improper configuration can itself become a source of rendering problems. For a custom font to be used, it must be correctly added to the project's assets and linked to the native Android project.
In modern React Native versions (0.69+), this involves creating a react-native.config.js file to declare the asset path and running the npx react-native-asset command to link the fonts.11 For Expo projects, using the expo-font plugin in app.json and creating a new development build is the standard procedure.12 Failure to perform these linking steps will result in the app falling back to the default system font, potentially re-introducing the fontWeight conflicts mentioned above.
Furthermore, inconsistencies in font naming can cause issues. On Android, the fontFamily style property often needs to match the font's filename (without the extension), whereas on iOS, it uses the PostScript name embedded within the font file.12 A common pitfall in Expo projects is a mismatch between the key used to define the font in the useFonts hook and the fontFamily name used in the style, which can lead to the font not being applied correctly on Android.12


3.1.3. The Impact of letterSpacing


The letterSpacing style property, which adjusts the space between characters, can also contribute to text truncation. While useful for stylistic purposes, applying a non-zero letterSpacing can interfere with the text measurement algorithm. The native layout engine may fail to account for the additional width introduced by the spacing, particularly near the end of a line, causing the final character to be clipped.9 If truncation occurs on text with this style, removing or setting letterSpacing: 0 is a valuable diagnostic step.


The lineHeight Conundrum and Vertical Clipping


A critical and increasingly common cause of vertical text clipping, particularly in React Native versions 0.78 and newer, is the mismanagement of the lineHeight style property. In these recent versions, the React Native team modified the Android text rendering implementation to better align with web standards. Previously, Android would arbitrarily shift text upwards within its line box. The new implementation centers the text vertically within the space defined by lineHeight.13
This change has a profound and direct consequence: if lineHeight is set to a value equal to fontSize, there is zero additional vertical space allocated for parts of characters that extend above the mean line (ascenders, like in 'h' or 'f') or below the baseline (descenders, like in 'g' or 'y'). Unlike web browsers, which may allow overflowing glyphs to be rendered, React Native's native views on both platforms strictly clip any content that extends beyond the bounds of its container.13
Therefore, a style declaration of { fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 16 } will almost certainly result in the tops and bottoms of many characters being visibly shaved off.13 This behavior is not a bug but the expected outcome of the new, more standards-compliant rendering model combined with React Native's strict clipping rules. The essential takeaway is that using a lineHeight equal to fontSize will cause vertical clipping.13


Flexbox Container Constraints and Overflow


Text truncation is not always a product of the <Text> component's own styles; it can often be caused by the constraints imposed by its parent containers. If a <Text> component is placed inside a <View> that has a fixed height or maxHeight style, any text that requires more vertical space than the container provides will be truncated.9 This is a common static configuration error, especially in designs that are not responsive to dynamic content length.
The issue can be compounded by nested containers. A developer might correctly ensure that the immediate parent of a <Text> component is flexible, but if that parent is itself contained within another <View> with restrictive dimensions, the text will still be clipped. Even setting overflow: 'visible' on an inner container will have no effect if an outer container is the one enforcing the clipping boundary.14 Debugging these issues requires inspecting the entire component hierarchy to identify the true source of the dimensional constraint.


System-Level Influences and Accessibility Settings


The Android operating system provides users with powerful accessibility settings that can directly impact text rendering, creating dynamic environment conflicts for applications that are not designed defensively. The two most significant settings are "Font size" and "Display size."
* Font Size: This setting applies a scaling factor to all text rendered on the device, allowing users with visual impairments to increase legibility.
* Display Size: This setting acts as a global zoom, scaling not just text but all UI elements.
When a user changes these settings, the operating system notifies all running applications. React Native's layout engine then re-calculates the UI with the new font and display metrics. If a layout was built with pixel-perfect, fixed dimensions, this sudden change can cause text to grow larger than its container, leading to widespread truncation.15 A known issue, particularly with React Native's New Architecture, is that the text measurement can be incorrect immediately after the setting is changed, only rendering correctly after the application is fully killed and restarted.16


Bugs and Regressions in React Native and Android OS


Finally, some truncation issues are the result of bona fide bugs or regressions in either the React Native framework or the Android OS itself. There is a long and ongoing history of text-related issues on the official React Native GitHub repository, indicating the persistent difficulty of this problem.10
A prominent recent example is a text rendering bug affecting Android 15 and 16. On these newer OS versions, text can be incorrectly rendered and cut off even when the layout and styling are otherwise correct. This issue has been reproduced in both bare React Native projects and those using Expo, and it appears to be exacerbated when a lineHeight is set or when the system's display zoom is adjusted.18 Such issues are beyond the direct control of an application developer and often require waiting for a patch from the React Native or Android teams. The only recourse in the interim is to experiment with workarounds, such as unsetting lineHeight, and to contribute to the bug reports with reproducible examples.

Solving Font and fontWeight Conflicts




4.2.1. Mitigating OEM Font Issues


To counteract the fontWeight: 'bold' conflicts on specific OEM devices, several strategies can be employed to force a different, more reliable rendering path.
1. Specify a Font Family: The most robust solution is to avoid relying on the device's default font. By specifying any fontFamily, even a generic one like 'Roboto' (the Android standard), you instruct the rendering engine to use a specific font file whose metrics are more likely to be calculated correctly.1 For true consistency, embedding a custom font is the best practice.
JavaScript
// Using a generic font family
<Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', fontFamily: 'sans-serif' }}>Bold Text</Text>

2. Use the Leading Spaces Hack: As a quick but less elegant workaround, prepending the text string with one or two blank spaces can sometimes trick the measurement algorithm into allocating the correct amount of space.1
JavaScript
<Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>{'  ' + 'My Bold Text'}</Text>

3. Set textBreakStrategy: This Android-specific property controls the algorithm used for line breaking. The default, 'highQuality', can sometimes cause measurement issues. Changing it to 'simple' uses a faster, less complex algorithm that can resolve truncation on some devices, particularly Samsung models.1
JavaScript
<Text textBreakStrategy={'simple'}>A long paragraph of text...</Text>



4.2.2. Robust Custom Font Implementation


For applications requiring a consistent brand identity, implementing custom fonts is essential. In a modern React Native project (v0.69+), the correct procedure is as follows:
   1. Place Font Files: Store your .ttf or .otf font files in a dedicated directory, such as ./assets/fonts/.
   2. Create Configuration File: In the root of your project, create a file named react-native.config.js.
   3. Declare Assets: Add the following configuration to the file, pointing to your fonts directory. This tells the React Native CLI where to find your font assets.
JavaScript
module.exports = {
 project: {
   ios: {},
   android: {},
 },
 assets: ['./assets/fonts/'],
};

   4. Link Assets: Run the asset linking command from your terminal. This command copies the font files into the native Android and iOS projects and updates the necessary build files.
Bash
npx react-native-asset

   5. Rebuild the App: After linking new assets, you must rebuild your native application (npx expo run:android or npx react-native run-android) for the changes to take effect.
   6. Use the Font: Reference the font in your styles using its filename (without the extension) as the fontFamily. For font weights, it is best practice to use the specific font file (e.g., 'MyFont-Bold') rather than applying fontWeight: 'bold' to the regular font file.11


Mastering Flexbox for Text Layout


As detailed in the analysis of the Text-in-a-Row Paradox, managing text within a flexDirection: 'row' container requires explicit Flexbox styling. The primary solution is to allow the <Text> component to shrink to fit the available space.
      * Applying flex: 1 or flexShrink: 1: This is the canonical solution for the paradox. It instructs the text element to occupy the remaining space in a row container after all other elements have been laid out, and to wrap its content within that space.2
JavaScript
<View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center' }}>
 <Icon name="info" size={24} />
 <Text style={{ flex: 1, marginLeft: 8 }}>
   This text will now correctly wrap and not overflow.
 </Text>
</View>

      * Using alignSelf: 'stretch': In some cases, particularly on OnePlus devices, text truncation can be resolved by forcing the <Text> component to stretch to the full width of its parent. This can be effective when the <Text> component is the sole child of a container and is still being clipped.1
JavaScript
<View>
 <Text style={{ alignSelf: 'stretch', textAlign: 'center' }}>
   This text will stretch to fill the parent width.
 </Text>
</View>



Managing Vertical Rhythm: lineHeight and padding




4.4.1. The lineHeight Golden Rule


To prevent the vertical clipping of ascenders and descenders caused by React Native's new text rendering model, a simple rule must be followed: lineHeight must be greater than fontSize. There is no universal perfect value, as it depends on the specific font's metrics, but a multiplier of 1.2 to 1.4 times the fontSize is a reliable starting point for most fonts.9


JavaScript




const FONT_SIZE = 16;
const LINE_HEIGHT = Math.round(FONT_SIZE * 1.3); // e.g., 21

//...

<Text style={{ fontSize: FONT_SIZE, lineHeight: LINE_HEIGHT }}>
 Glyphs like 'g' and 'h' will not be clipped.
</Text>



4.4.2. The Role of includeFontPadding (Android Only)


Android's native TextView includes extra vertical padding by default to ensure that characters from any language or font have enough space and are not clipped. This behavior is exposed in React Native through the includeFontPadding style property, which defaults to true.19
While this default is safe, it can make precise vertical alignment difficult, as the visible text may not be perfectly centered within the component's bounding box. Setting includeFontPadding: false removes this extra padding, giving the developer more direct control over the text's vertical position.21 However, when this property is set to false, it becomes even more critical to manage lineHeight correctly, as the safety padding has been removed, making clipping more likely if the lineHeight is insufficient.


4.4.3. The textAlignVertical Property (Android Only)


This Android-specific property controls the vertical alignment of text within its container, which is especially useful for single-line text inside elements like buttons. It can be set to 'top', 'center', or 'bottom'.22
The most effective use of this property is in combination with includeFontPadding: false. By removing the font's internal padding and then explicitly setting textAlignVertical: 'center', one can achieve true, pixel-perfect vertical centering of text within a container of a fixed height.9


JavaScript




<View style={{ height: 48, justifyContent: 'center', backgroundColor: '#eee' }}>
 <Text style={{
   includeFontPadding: false,
   textAlignVertical: 'center'
 }}>
   Perfectly Centered
 </Text>
</View>



Handling System-Level Scaling


To ensure design consistency across all user devices, regardless of their accessibility settings, developers can choose to disable font scaling. This prevents the text from resizing when the user changes the "Font size" setting in the Android OS. This can be done globally by setting default props on the Text and TextInput components at the application's entry point (e.g., App.js).


JavaScript




import { Text, TextInput } from 'react-native';

// Disable font scaling for all Text components
if (Text.defaultProps == null) Text.defaultProps = {};
Text.defaultProps.allowFontScaling = false;

// Disable font scaling for all TextInput components
if (TextInput.defaultProps == null) TextInput.defaultProps = {};
TextInput.defaultProps.allowFontScaling = false;

It is crucial to recognize that while this approach guarantees visual consistency, it is an anti-pattern for accessibility. Disabling font scaling can make an application unusable for individuals who rely on larger text sizes.
A more accessibility-friendly approach is to embrace scaling but build a responsive UI. The useWindowDimensions hook provides the current fontScale value set by the user.23 Developers can use this value to create a dynamic sizing system, adjusting not only font sizes but also margins, padding, and container dimensions to ensure the layout reflows gracefully when the text size changes.


JavaScript




import { useWindowDimensions, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
 const { fontScale } = useWindowDimensions();

 const styles = StyleSheet.create({
   title: {
     // Adjust font size based on the system scale, but cap it to prevent extreme sizes
     fontSize: Math.min(24 / fontScale, 32),
   },
 });

 //...
};



Advanced Methodologies for Proactive Text Management




Proactive Sizing: Dynamic Text Measurement


The most advanced strategy for preventing text truncation involves shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach. Instead of designing a container and hoping the text fits, this methodology involves measuring the text's required dimensions before it is rendered and then dynamically creating a container of the appropriate size. This transforms a layout problem, which is often discovered visually at runtime, into a predictable data-flow problem that can be solved programmatically.
React Native provides a built-in prop, onTextLayout, which is a callback that fires after the initial render and provides the layout metrics of the text, including the dimensions and an array of lines.24 This can be used to adjust the UI after the first render cycle.
For a more powerful, pre-rendering solution, third-party libraries like react-native-text-size offer asynchronous functions to measure text dimensions without needing to render the component to the screen first.25 These libraries take a string of text and a set of styling parameters (like fontSize, fontWeight, and a constrained width) and return the calculated height and line count.25
A conceptual implementation using such a library would follow this pattern:
         1. In a component's state, initialize a textHeight variable to a default or minimum value.
         2. In a useEffect hook, call the measurement library's function with the text content, font styles, and the available container width.
         3. When the promise resolves with the calculated height, update the component's state with the new textHeight.
         4. Use this state variable to style the height of the text's container, ensuring it is always perfectly sized for its content.
This method programmatically guarantees that the container will be large enough, eliminating truncation caused by insufficient space. It is particularly valuable for dynamic content of unknown length, such as user-generated text or API responses.


Architectural Prevention: Building a Resilient Typography System


The multitude of workarounds and device-specific fixes required to achieve consistent text rendering strongly argues against ad-hoc styling. The most robust and maintainable long-term solution is to build a centralized, application-wide typography system.
This involves creating a set of custom, reusable text components that encapsulate all necessary styling and platform-specific logic. Instead of using the base <Text> component directly, developers would use components like <BodyText>, <Heading1>, <Caption>, and <ButtonText>.6
Each of these custom components would be pre-configured with the application's design tokens and all the necessary preventative styles:
         * A specific fontFamily from the app's custom font set.
         * A lineHeight value calculated to be appropriately larger than its fontSize.
         * The allowFontScaling={false} prop (if that is the chosen accessibility strategy).
         * Any other required styles, such as textBreakStrategy: 'simple'.
The benefits of this architectural pattern are significant:
         1. Consistency: It ensures that all text throughout the application adheres to the same design system and rendering rules, creating a polished and professional user experience.
         2. Maintainability: If a new text-rendering bug emerges on a future version of Android, the fix can be implemented in a single location (the relevant typography component) and will be instantly propagated across the entire application. This is vastly more efficient than searching for and patching every individual <Text> instance.
         3. Improved Developer Experience: It abstracts away the complexity of text rendering. Developers on the team no longer need to remember the long list of potential issues and workarounds; they can simply choose the appropriate semantic component from the typography system and be confident that it will render correctly and consistently.


Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations




Summary of Key Principles


The analysis of text truncation in React Native on Android reveals a complex interplay between the framework's architecture, the diversity of the native platform, and the developer's implementation choices. The resolution of these issues hinges on the mastery of several key principles:
         * The Layout Dichotomy: Acknowledge the fundamental difference between Flexbox layout for containers and the native text layout system used by the <Text> component. This understanding is crucial for diagnosing layout conflicts.
         * Device-Specific Quirks: Accept that the fragmented Android ecosystem is a primary source of rendering inconsistencies. Problems related to fontWeight and system fonts are not bugs in your code but environmental conflicts that require defensive styling.
         * Vertical Rhythm Management: The relationship between fontSize and lineHeight is the most critical factor in preventing vertical clipping. A lineHeight greater than fontSize is non-negotiable for correct rendering in modern React Native versions.
         * Architectural Abstraction: The most effective long-term strategy is to move beyond individual fixes and build a centralized typography system of custom components. This enforces consistency, simplifies maintenance, and encapsulates complex workarounds.


A Developer's Checklist for Preventing Text Truncation


To integrate these findings into a practical development workflow, developers should adhere to the following checklist:
         1. For Text in a Row: When placing a <Text> component alongside other elements in a flexDirection: 'row' container, always apply flex: 1 or flexShrink: 1 to the <Text> component's style to prevent overflow.
         2. For All Text: Globally enforce a rule where lineHeight is always set to a value demonstrably greater than fontSize. A ratio of 1.2-1.4 is a reliable starting point.
         3. For Bold Text: Prioritize the use of a custom font with a specific bold weight file (e.g., fontFamily: 'Inter-Bold') over applying the generic fontWeight: 'bold' style, especially if not using a custom font.
         4. For Vertical Alignment on Android: For precise vertical control, especially in components like buttons, use the combination of includeFontPadding: false and textAlignVertical: 'center'.
         5. For Architecture: Abstract all text elements into a set of custom, reusable components (e.g., <Body>, <Heading>). This should be considered a foundational part of any new project.
         6. For Testing: Do not rely solely on Expo Go or a single emulator. The testing process must include physical Android devices, with a focus on brands known for heavy OS customization, such as Samsung, OnePlus, and Xiaomi.
         7. For Accessibility: Make a conscious and explicit decision regarding allowFontScaling. If it is disabled to enforce design consistency, ensure the default font sizes meet accessibility standards for legibility. If it is enabled, build flexible and responsive layouts that can reflow gracefully to accommodate larger text sizes.
